FIRST WE CREATE A NEW FILE FOR THE MEDIA QUERIES

WE WILL USE THE TWO METHODS WE DISCUSSED: LOOK AT WHERE OUR DESIGN BREAKS, 

WE MUST PAY ATTENTION TO THE max-width WE SET ON OUR CONTAINERS

1.FIRST WE WILL MAKE THE HERO WIDE AS THE REST OF THE PAGE AT 1300PX AND 1366PX (HERO IS 1300, REST OF THE PAGE IS 1200).


/* rem and em do NOT depend on html font-size in media queries! Instead, 1rem = 1em = 16px */

1.WE WANT THE VALUE TO BE 1344px, BUT WE CALCULATED 1344/16 BECAUSE OF WHAT WE SAID ABOVE. THIS GAVE US 84, SO WE USE 84em.


@media(max-width:84em){
  .hero{
    max-width: 120rem;
  }
}


2. BUT WITH THIS WE CREATED A NEW PROBLEM, AND THAT IS THE HEADING NOW CHANGED ITS LINES (IT AUTOMATICALLY OCCUPIES 4 LINES INSTEAD OF 3, SO IT JUMPS AROUND).

@media(max-width:84em){
  .hero{
    max-width: 120rem;
  }
  .heading-primary{
    font-size: 4.4rem; <====== NOW IT WORKS
  }
}


3. NOW THE GRID OF IMAGES WAY BELOW JUMPS AROUND, SO WE SIMPLY MAKE IT OCCUPY LESS (IT OCCUPIED 3 COLUMNS BEFORE)

@media(max-width:84em){
  .hero{
    max-width: 120rem;
  }
  .heading-primary{
    font-size: 4.4rem;
  }

 
  .gallery{ <=====
    grid-template-columns: repeat(2,1fr);
  }

}
