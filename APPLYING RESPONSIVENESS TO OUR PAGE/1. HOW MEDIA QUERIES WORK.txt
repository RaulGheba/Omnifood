LETS SAY WE WANT TO APPLY A CERTAIN STYLE FOR A RANGE B E T W E E N 0 AND 600.

@media (max-width: 600px); => IS THE CURRENT VIEWPORT WIDTH SMALLER OR EQUAL THAN 600px?

=> MAXIMUM WIDTH AT WHICH MEDIA QUERY STILL APPLIES

AFTER 600, IT S T O P S WORKING.

@media (max-width: 600px); => IS THE CURRENT VIEWPORT WIDTH SMALLER OR EQUAL THAN 1200px?

AFTER 1200, IT S T O P S WORKING.

BUT IF I AM ON A PHONE WITH A WIDTH OF 400px, WHICH MEDIA QUERY APPLIES IN THIS SITUATION?

B O T H QUERIES APPLY, BECAUSE BOTH THE CONDITIONS ARE TRUE => 400px ARE LESS THAN 600px, A N D LESS THAN 1200px.


=========================

INSIDE THE MEDIA QUERIES WE SIMPLY OVERWRITE SOME SPECIFIC PARTS OF THE GLOBAL CSS => THE CODE THAT'S OUTSIDE ANY MEDIA QUERY.

IF YOU HAVE CONFLICTING CSS DECLARATIONS IN THESE QUERIES, WHICH IS USUALLY THE CASE, THE ONE WHICH APPEARS LAST IN THE CODE IS THE ONE WHICH APPLIES


LETS TAKE A TABLET WITH 1000px OF WIDTH. ONLY THE 1200px MEDIA QUERY APPLIES.
