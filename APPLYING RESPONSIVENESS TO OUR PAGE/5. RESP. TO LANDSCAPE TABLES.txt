AS WE DECREASE THE VIEWPORT AT 1200 WE NOTICE THAT THE TEXT IS HUGE IN SOME PLACES, AS WELL AS THE SPACING. WE MUST MAKE THIS SMALLER.

WE CAN NOW USE TO OUR ADVANTAGE THE FACT THAT WE USED RESPONSIVE UNITS FROM THE VERY START.

SINCE ALL ELEMENTS ARE DESIGNED WITH rem, WE CAN PULL UP THE html ELEMENT AND MODIFY THE FONT-SIZE! 

I WANT TO SET IT TO 9px. 
9/16 = 56.25%

@media (max-width: 75em) {
  html {
    font-size: 56.25%;
  }

  .grid {
    column-gap: 4.8rem;
    row-gap: 6.4rem;
  }
  .heading-secondary {
    font-size: 3.6rem;
  }

  .heading-tertiary {
    font-size: 2.4rem;
  }

  .header {
    padding: 0 3.2rem;
  }

  .main-nav-list {
    gap: 3.2rem;
  }

  .hero {
    gap: 4.8rem;
  }

  .testimonials-container {
    padding: 9.6rem 3.2rem;
  }
}
