BREAKPOINTS ARE THE VIEWPORT WIDTH AT WHICH WE WANT OUR DESIGN TO CHANGE 

BAD = BASED ON POPULAR DEVICES

GOOD = BASED ON SCREEN WIDTH RANGES. WE LOOK AT THE MOST USED WIDTH FOR DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF DEVICES LIKE PHONES OR TABLETS OR DESKTOP COMPUTERS, THEN WE TRY TO GROUP THEM TOGETHER IN SOME LOGICAL WAY TO THEN PICK
OUR BREAKPOINTS FROM THAT. THIS WAY WE ENGULF MANY DIFFERENT DEVICES.

PERFECT = ALL ABOUT SETTING BREAKPOINTS AT PLACES WHERE THE DESIGN BREAKS DOWN - WE DECREASE THE WIDTH AND AS SOON AS THINGS START TO BREAK DOWN, WE INTERVENE AND ADD BREAKPOINTS.

WE WILL USE THE PERFECT STRAT TOGETHER WITH THE GOOD STRAT BECAUSE ITS HARD TO NOT THINK ABOUT DEVICES.
